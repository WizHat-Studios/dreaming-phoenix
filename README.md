# Dreaming Phoenix
The open source soundboard for playing music and sound effects in real time.

## What is Dreaming Phoenix?
Dreaming Phoenix is a soundboard designed for playing music tracks and sound effects simultaneously. The original idea was that it should be used by game and dungeon masters in tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder. Despite this idea, it is not only intended for these use cases and can therefore be used in a variety of other ways.
